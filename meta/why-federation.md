# Why Federation?

Oftentimes, you will encounter "federated" as a feature of a project, especially in our [awesome-list](https://github.com/open-webtech/awesome-webtech#readme). Why is that, and what are the advantages of federation?

## Privacy and User Control

Federation is better for privacy – not inherently, but it empowers users to choose the very instance where they feel safe. Unlike centralized systems, federated networks consist of multiple independent servers (instances), each with its own policies and controls. This diversity allows users to select an instance that aligns with their privacy preferences and data protection standards, enhancing their sense of security and control over personal information.

## Enhanced Community Interaction

Federation allows software to foster greater community interaction, connecting as many users as possible across different instances. This decentralized approach encourages vibrant and diverse communities where users can interact freely, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. The increased interaction within federated networks can lead to the formation of new friendships and stronger community bonds.

## Technical Benefits

Federated systems provide several technical advantages. First, by spreading data across multiple servers, the failure of one server does not impact the entire network. This distribution ensures enhanced reliability and higher uptime for services. Second, federated networks are highly scalable. Each new instance can function independently while still being part of the larger network, reducing the load on any single server and facilitating seamless growth. Finally, they allow for extensive customization. Every instance in a federated network can be tailored to meet the unique needs of its user base. This flexibility provides a more personalized experience, catering to specific communities and preferences.

## Real-World Examples

Several successful projects utilize federation to their advantage:

- **Mastodon**: A microblogging platform that uses the [ActivityPub] federation protocol to connect various independently operated servers. Users on different Mastodon instances can interact with each other seamlessly, creating a diverse and interconnected social network, while offering users a choice in their community environment.
- **Matrix**: An open standard for decentralized communication, enabling secure messaging and VoIP across diverse networks. Matrix allows different chat applications to interoperate, giving users the freedom to choose their preferred client.
- **Nextcloud**: While primarily a self-hosted productivity platform, Nextcloud offers some federation capabilities like Federated Cloud Sharing: Users can share files and folders with users on other Nextcloud instances, enabling cross-instance collaboration.

## Conclusion

Federation offers a wealth of benefits that make it a compelling choice for modern web technologies. By empowering users with greater privacy and control, enhancing community interaction, and fostering resilience and censorship resistance, federated systems represent a more open, democratic, and robust approach to digital communication and collaboration.

We encourage you to explore federated projects and consider how they might fit into your digital life or development work. Whether you're a user seeking more control and privacy or a developer interested in expanding your project portfolio or contributing to open, decentralized platforms, the fediverse offers exciting opportunities to engage with and shape the future of the web.

It advocates for a flexible, user-centric approach that allows for multiple personas and easy transitions between identity providers.

- [The Agentic Fediverse](https://github.com/zicklag/agentic-fediverse) – The "Agentic Fediverse" proposes a new kind of federation, envisioning a "second generation" iteration of the concept currently established with ActivityPub. It's a work-in-progress experiment that originated from the [Commune] group.
