# The Certification Process

This document describes the OWTA certification process, guiding project maintainers from the initial application to achieving certification.

## Benefits of Certification

Achieving OWTA certification offers several benefits:

- **Recognition:** Receive a shoutout and a shiny badge to show off your dedication to the principles of openness.
- **Credibility:** Enhance your project's credibility and attract more contributors and users.
- **Networking:** Connect with a community of like-minded developers and innovators.

## Stages

The certification process involves several stages:

### 1. Application

Project maintainers interested in obtaining OWTA certification can apply through our discussion forum. This can be done by creating a new post in the **Association â†’ Certification** category, accessible through the shortlink <https://apply.owta.dev>.

A complete application submission must include the following information:

- **Project Information:** Detailed information about the project, including its goals, values, and alignment with OWTA principles.
- **Supporting Documentation:** Relevant documentation such as project roadmaps, contribution guidelines, and community engagement strategies.

### 2. Initial Review

- **Administrative Check:** Our team will conduct an initial review to ensure that the application is complete and all necessary documentation is provided.
- **Preliminary Assessment:** A preliminary assessment will be conducted to determine if the project meets the criteria for OWTA certification.

### 3. Feedback and Revisions

- **Feedback Report:** The OWTA team will provide a feedback report highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and any necessary revisions.
- **Revisions:** Project maintainers will have the opportunity to address the feedback and make necessary adjustments to their project.

### 4. Final Assessment

- **Re-evaluation:** After revisions are made, the project will undergo a final assessment to ensure all feedback has been adequately addressed.
- **Certification Decision:** The OWTA Certification Committee will make the final decision on whether to grant certification.

### 5. Certification Award

- **Certification Announcement:** Successful projects will be officially announced and added to the OWTA certified projects list.
- **Certification Badge:** Projects will receive a certification badge to display on their website and promotional materials.
