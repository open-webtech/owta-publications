## Stages

The certification process involves several stages:

### 1. Application

### 3. Feedback and Revisions

- **Feedback Report:** The OWTA team will provide a feedback report highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and any necessary revisions.
- **Revisions:** Project maintainers will have the opportunity to address the feedback and make necessary adjustments to their project.

### 4. Final Assessment

- **Re-evaluation:** After revisions are made, the project will undergo a final assessment to ensure all feedback has been adequately addressed.
- **Certification Decision:** The OWTA Certification Committee will make the final decision on whether to grant certification.

### 5. Certification Award
